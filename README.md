### Book Recommendation System Using Correlation and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### Project Overview:

The objective of this project was to build a book recommendation system using two different approaches:

1. Correlation-based Recommendation

2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Recommendation

We began with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand and preprocess the dataset. After data cleaning and visualization, we applied correlation-based analysis and KNN algorithms to recommend books. The project successfully provided personalized book recommendations using both methods.

### Steps Performed:

#### Data Collection and Preprocessing:

1. Acquired the book dataset consisting of book details, user information, and ratings.

2. Cleaned the data by removing duplicates and handling missing values.

3. Converted the dataset into a suitable format for analysis.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

1. Visualized the distribution of book ratings and user preferences.

2. Identified popular books and explored reading patterns.

3. Examined the sparsity of the dataset using heatmaps and histograms.

#### Correlation-Based Recommendation:

1. Created a user-item matrix where rows represented users and columns represented books.

2. Calculated the correlation between books based on user ratings.

3. Recommended books that had a high correlation score with a given book.

#### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Recommendation:

1. Implemented the KNN algorithm using the user-item matrix.

2. Used distance metrics to find the most similar books to a given book.

3. Generated personalized recommendations for users based on their reading history.

#### Evaluation:

1. Assessed the recommendations qualitatively by reviewing sample outputs.

2. Compared results from both approaches to check their effectiveness.

### Results:

1. The correlation-based approach successfully recommended books that were highly related to the userâ€™s preferences.

2. The KNN-based system provided accurate and personalized recommendations using nearest neighbors.

3. Both methods effectively enhanced user experience by suggesting relevant books.

4. Correlation-based recommendations were faster for smaller datasets, while KNN showed better performance for large datasets.
